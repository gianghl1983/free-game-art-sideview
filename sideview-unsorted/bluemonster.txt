Animated blue monster spritesheet. Here's another piece that I had been meaning to finish. The animations are: walk/run, rest animation. not meant to be looped, and a jump animation. You might need to ajust this depending on which engine you use. I've included the original vector so you should have no problem building new spitesheets. As well as the vector I've pre-prepared some spritesheets so you can use them in your game straight away. each frame on the sheet is 512 pixels by 512 pixels
