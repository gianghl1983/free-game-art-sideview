My first art that doesn't look like a random spot but looks like an actual thing.

Maybe there is place for it in your RPG or roguelike.

Contains 3 animations: death, attack and "walking".

P.S. I'd like to make a small sci-fi game. Maybe someone have ideas that could be implemented within two or three weeks?

P.P.S. Please tell me about mistakes in the description. I rarely write something in English.
