Based upon this vector character (http://opengameart.org/content/sorlo-a-funny-sorcerer), here is a sprite set for an 8-bit puzzle game based around creating and removing blocks to get all the keys and exit the level.

The sprite sheet is complete, though it is very basic and may require some extra sprites. (it also includes some hints on animating them.)

(Note to doudoulolita and redshrike: it would be very nice if any of you would tell me if it's possible to change the license to CC-BY (as in the Ultimate Smash Friends character sprite sheet). )
